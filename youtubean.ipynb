As Marrese-Taylor et al. Evaluated their models on 5 fold cross validation they do not have one train, test set therefore we create a 70% train and 30% test dataset, we then save the new train and test dataset in XML format just like the original format. This format is the same as [SemEval 2014](http://alt.qcri.org/semeval2014/task4/) XML format."
